# Thw world of AI:

**The world of artificial intelligence is very large, and thus it is subdivided into its subclasses, in which the best known to us, such as: Machine Learning, Deep Leaning, for example.**
## Basic Concepts:

- **Machine Learning:** It is the ability of the computer or machine, as the name implies, to be able to learn and perform better and optimize the processor from a large amount of data. Its objectives are based on **optimizing these processes, in order to look for patterns, learn, study and evolve.**

- **Deep Learning:** Here, it is a subfield of Machine Learning, and it applies machine learning in a more complex way. Its goal starts from data layers, in which it **provides and tries to make predictions about data and in a scalable way.**
